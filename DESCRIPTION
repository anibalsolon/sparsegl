Description: Performs sparse group lasso with optional bound constraints on
  the coefficients. Supports the use of a sparse design matrix as well as 
  returning coefficient estimates in a sparse matrix. Furthermore, it correctly
  calculates the degrees of freedom to allow for information criteria rather
  than cross-validation with very large data.
